# Pathfinding Using Cellular Automata: Applications and Algorithms

## Introduction
This repository contains code and documentation related to the implementation and analysis of pathfinding using cellular automata. Pathfinding is a fundamental problem in various domains, including robotics, navigation systems, and computer games. Cellular automata provide an interesting computational model for solving pathfinding problems due to their decentralized and parallel nature.

## Contents
- `code/`: This directory contains the source code for implementing the A* and Dijkstry algorithm within a cellular automaton environment.
- `latex/`: My bachelor work
  
## Implementation Details
The A* algorithm has been adapted to work within the framework of cellular automata. This involves defining the state transitions and heuristics within the automaton to enable efficient pathfinding. The implementation has been written in Python, making it easily accessible and adaptable for different projects.
